# java-collection-util

Collections are very important data types in any programming language. They store
**data**. We use collections to *organize* and *operate* with data. These things
are so very fundamental to all of our programs. Java does provide a lot a basic
functionality with collections, but they aren't enough. Nothing might ever be enough.
Yet some more collection related operations are becoming quite common and hence are
being added here in a separate class. More functionality will be added as per need.
